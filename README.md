## HELP IN NEED
- I photoshoped an icon for now, but I dont like much, if you are interested in helping me, please contact me.
- Personal developer, donation in need.

## IN THE FUTURE
- Dpad view is ugly and hard to use, prepare to replace it with joystick.
- PokemonGo takes too long to respond moving actions, try to make this better, but dont got a clue.
